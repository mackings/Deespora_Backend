I ordered the seasoned beef (yeawaze tibs) and vegetable combo which was served on a large plate over a large piece of bread very similar to a fluffy crepe.  It is also served with a side of the bread (injera, 30% barley 70% \"teff\") which you tear off and use to grab pieces of meat and veggies (Lentils, cabbage and carrots, spinach greens).  If you're traditional you use only your bare right hand to eat with, which can be a bit off putting for some but it's how it's done.  Just wash your hands before and after in the very basic facilities.\n\nThe flavors are all there, about as authentic as you can get them in So Cal.  The atmosphere is about as close to what you might get sitting at a small cafe in Addis Ababa too.  Well seasoned food with a variety of flavors.  There is also a lot of food, and after ordering the two dishes I ended up taking him about half of it even with two people eating.\n\nThis is a very small restaurant, blink and you'll miss it kind of establishment with no dedicated parking, just street park where you can.  Inside the place is a very tiny main dining area (1 four top, 1 two top) and what looks like a larger social room but only for sitting on the floor (reserved or dedicated?).  I didn't really get the impression that being a restaurant was their main focus, as the kitchen was far bigger than the dining room (I think they make the specialty bread and sell it as a big part of their income).\n\nI really enjoyed the experience, the very homestyle feeling of the place like you're walking into someone's home.  For some people the whole no frills experience might be a huge turnoff, but it was definitely not for me.  I concede it was odd to see a very limited selection of bottled beverages in a cooler that wasn't chilled, so I can understand why some people might not care for it.  For me though, it's discovering these kinds of little places that make me wish I had infinite Time, a vast budget, and a bottomless stomach.","time":1558128783,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Omega Othow","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102367367699634976027/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW_uKUrFYm5N1QYyGSWWPA_x7_BFV0RN6_DTf_TaEmb0dQ1lH5F=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"I used to go to there with my mom and one time when I was little the day after I came back from the airport the lady at the register was like \"aren't you the girl from the Ethiopian tv\" it made my day knowing that she watched me on tv meet the pri-minister of Ethiopia I hope she will remember me when I go back","time":1660451182,"translated":false}]},{"business_status":"OPERATIONAL","geometry":{"location":{"lat":34.0155069,"lng":-118.3433355},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":34.01695912989273,"lng":-118.3419160701073},"southwest":{"lat":34.01425947010728,"lng":-118.3446157298927}}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v1/png_71/restaurant-71.png","icon_background_color":"#FF9E67","icon_mask_base_uri":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v2/restaurant_pinlet","name":"Yordanos Ethiopian Restaurant","opening_hours":{"open_now":false},"photos":[{"height":540,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/101440551388936360130\">Yordanos Ethiopian Restaurant</a>"],"photo_reference":"AciIO2fRNbjReNxTGxnbbaqFRCDQ7rxhTEVP5z5aGfug1MZI_oGXEDleZNIjT_UmAByZK1TONVPHqzy2ZTeezcGfAOGu4SuDdOPmER5OrKi2S_62tWinwCoZXFw2E8p8WEgULvFpUTN_N-2HFBPIPu5QzsZvMkc_PV0OLMTdCPSeSbUms8M-pJ4SsgjbthjW872Vw-IikyicgtcY_kYUYm1gz29KYqCfvZmO2cB4-w5QxtiK0EQwa9rBjT4dL8pT6OwvIY3bl8MnCOQ07q4UzWmAU5Uqg2B8TyoeNYOB0pi-yGzwmlJq3qo","width":720}],"place_id":"ChIJ1XZ2z5a5woAR4t2MZZ_jTHc","plus_code":{"compound_code":"2M84+6M Los Angeles, California","global_code":"85632M84+6M"},"price_level":2,"rating":4.7,"reference":"ChIJ1XZ2z5a5woAR4t2MZZ_jTHc","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"user_ratings_total":138,"vicinity":"4020 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Los Angeles","city":"Los Angeles","reviews":[{"author_name":"Jared Cohee","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100628241609761386745/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUpasAzyfZG-a6jI5qHnpVjVHF4jxygbQwCyBaNxbNgGwztGFrXoA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba7","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"🇪🇹 ETHIOPIA (via Eat the World Los Angeles) - When you arrive at Yordanos in Crenshaw, the exterior does not hint to the joy that you will eventually find inside.

I was familiar wnough with ethiopian food from a prior visit that one takes a piece of the injera and scoops up a mouthful portion and enjoy.\n\n... is tomato, spices with onions and ground beef with a tanky flavor. It was very mild and quite tasty.\n\n.... is a bit like carne asada mixed with onion and seasoning which was very satisfying.\n\n... omg the beef with collard greens was amazing. Flavorful and mildly seasoned paired well with the bread.\n\nYebeg Alicha... the bread, injera, was soaked with beef and seasoning with a tangy flavir.\n\nKitfo ... was ground steak tartar which will make you spice lovers extremely happy.\n\n... an even spicier chicken and vegetable dish with hard boiled egg.\n\nThis dish was a wonderful way to sample such an awesome variety of foods and flavors.

To make matters worse, after keeping a customer waiting that long, there was no apology, no complimentary item, or any gesture to make up for the inconvenience.

This occasion made me visit at least 2-3 other times.\n\nOn the 2nd or third time, I didn't really care for the wings because they were starting to get a little too big, and I like my wings on the smaller side. The rice is always great with the  sauce they provide and more than enough plantains. The last time I went, I got the lamb, and that was really good. I'll definitely return, but the area is kind of busy with traffic and not the easiest to get to when I'm commuting.\n\nPost Update 6/29/25: I visited this establishment again for at least the 4th time. The side sauce that you eat with the rice was amazing! I should've gotten the jollof rice because the white rice was very mediocre. It was a little overcooked and not as fluffy and Shelly as the last couple of times when I had it. I ordered the half lamb, half chicken. The lamb was delicious and cooked to perfection. The chicken was just \"ok,\" and I'll need to broil it at home to get it completely right.\n\nI also found out that I had a free reward for an order of six chicken wings. The wings were fine but not up to par of where they were before. You can tell they were sitting because they were not as crispy when I visited previous times. Overall, the food was mostly good and suffice, so I'll rate my recent experience a 7.8/10.

From the moment you step through the doors, you're transported to the heart of Africa with the warm and inviting atmosphere, traditional decor, and delightful aromas wafting from the kitchen.\n\nThe menu is a culinary adventure through Zimbabwean and African cuisine, with dishes that are both comforting and exotic. I especially loved the tender Mazondo, which was rich and flavorful, and the spicy Maguru, which had just the right amount of heat. The Sadza was the perfect accompaniment, and I loved using it to soak up all the delicious sauces.\n\nTo top it off, the service was impeccable. The staff was friendly, attentive, and happy to recommend dishes and drinks. Speaking of drinks, the Amarula was an absolute standout. Creamy, sweet, and smooth, it was the perfect way to cap off a fantastic meal.\n\nIf you're looking for an authentic African dining experience, you won't be disappointed with Zambos Restaurant.

We ordered the herbed jollof rice, grilled chicken leg quarters, peppered turkey flats, and a stewed spinach dish. Since our order was quite large, we did have to wait about half an hour, so chef treated us with 2 boxes of fresh puff puff! These were like bite-sized Nigerian beignets, dusted with nutmeg and cinnamon sugar, and had 2 dipping options of habanero+mango and a sweet creamy glaze-like sauce. So thoughtful, and really curbed our hanger. Once we brought the food home, I did not take a great picture, because the smell was so intoxicating that we all dug right in.

That level of hospitality is rare.\n\nThe space is no-frills—a classic hole-in-the-wall—but the food and the owner’s warmth more than make up for it. If you’re looking for East African food and genuine service, this place is well worth a visit.","time":1751683454,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Björn Zachrisson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101318238083023126040/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUng7WCMtRkpjSe2jLeTx3HOOrggZC5gD6965qTDr9im8QXtev7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"In the picture is $15 of fantastic African food!

My recent visit to this gem left me craving more of its authentic dishes.\n\nI decided to try the **Amala and Ewedu soup with fish and goat meat**, and it was nothing short of amazing. The Amala was soft and smooth, just as it should be, and paired perfectly with the rich, savory Ewedu soup. The flavors were incredibly well-balanced, with the Ewedu bringing that classic, slightly earthy taste that complements the mild, fermented undertone of the Amala.\n\nThe goat meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of spice to give it a flavorful kick. The fish added another layer of deliciousness to the dish, flaky and well-cooked, soaking up the savory goodness of the soup.\n\nBeyond the delicious food, the atmosphere at Toni’s African Deli is warm and inviting, with a friendly staff that makes you feel right at home. Whether you’re an aficionado of African cuisine or trying it for the first time, Toni’s African Deli is a must-visit.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for something truly comforting and hearty, I highly recommend giving Toni’s African Deli a try. You won’t be disappointed!","time":1726191020,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sharrise Whitfield","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113589828833124653886/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVCVngCXd-StRKnh2gLoQGinyzaL7QhmF-NSfvm-U-PvxrtJ3o=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"OVERPRICED ! I’m a mom who cooks at home often , and I rarely get takeout because it’s overpriced and not the most healthiest choice. I HATE wasting my money especially in these times ! Let me say this,  I LOVE African Food and have tried many different restaurants in the cities.  I decided to get dinner here, my first time visiting this place. I paid $20. and some change , for Spinach/rice, they did throw in the ‘hot pepper’ since I guess you have to ask for it and it’s an additional charge and they only take cash for items under $5.,  I didn’t know you had to ask , I just thought about it from experiences at other establishments and then wondered if it came with it, ok fine. Moving on to the food, the spinach bowl was small for $20. in my opinion, I mean who’s counting the rice , its rice and I got plenty of that, you’d think it would be the other way around. There were 3 medium size pieces of meat that pretty much overpowered the whole bowl of spinach with regards to size , I think the amount of spinach had to be no more than a ice cream scoop and unfortunately it was super oily and bland, NO flavor , just heavy on the grease and chewy meat with a splash of red sauce on top which was spicy. My stomach is bubbling right now !! Unfortunately after about 3 try’s , I couldn’t take another bite and my kids didn’t want any, so I had to cook anyway !!! I’m so frustrated with restaurants playing in my face! I think the restaurant should take some time and reevaluate their recipes and  the overall flavor if they feel that they deserve what they’re charging, and try ASKING customers if they’d like to add a side of pepper or let them know the food is already spicy  !!! Gee wiz simple customer service goes a long way to see to it that your customers are prepared especially for culturally made dishes. You don’t know who’s walking in that door. Honestly I’d be happy with the price only if the food was good and worth it, it’s possible (I’ve been to plenty upscale restaurants who upcharge for great tasting small portions) I won’t be back until the reviews are at 5 stars, becausw then I’ll know someone listened and took some of this feedback as an opportunity, but meanwhile I wouldn’t recommend!!","time":1717894886,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Anastaria Carter","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113526242571451676747/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW5dYJHMp0-dek2IiUucl5Fx4ucLOa7b4uPfswLBH5UzXw4A1j7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"I ordered through Uber eats and it was the Egusi with goat meat with extra meat and fufu.

Food didn't take forever and the lady at the counter was sweet, friendly ans informative\n\nCons: The menu isn't very accurate because it didn't not that certain meats had a small unchanrge which I found annoying.\n\nAlso, not their fault, but the surrounding area is in not that nice looking of a location but honestly when you go inside, the place looks decent.\n\nOverall, I'd say this place is great and highly recommended if your looking for some good Nigerian or Ghanaian food","time":1746031119,"translated":false}]},{"business_status":"OPERATIONAL","geometry":{"location":{"lat":39.9252483,"lng":-75.23505829999999},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":39.92655157989272,"lng":-75.23365827010727},"southwest":{"lat":39.92385192010727,"lng":-75.23635792989272}}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v1/png_71/restaurant-71.png","icon_background_color":"#FF9E67","icon_mask_base_uri":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v2/restaurant_pinlet","name":"Susanna African Kitchen","opening_hours":{"open_now":false},"photos":[{"height":2988,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/103162200703090205048\">Susanna African Kitchen</a>"],"photo_reference":"AciIO2cZZHY2vGuxhj2MAHpFCSQO7VuD_VH5FXd0ccSD85q3huS6m1737dOqmVPB4QkG1fdTMxw4a-7ds4vJekLkIkuCmbpJZRfFgnVE-u-Pi_QAyqgU8QKxK2Zx0S17X0h3KQNs3TW8m31jH24OmMu7dswLUStvtpPKXZ6V7vjWTYNPPlMNgcNRzfyDU5ulNG_IXqdijkEl3U_Ol2CLD-hdy6D3t4CcxIf2AMD3gwJf9c9-H6Mvfqd3WG8pE6aYzbO7PWGp6d9NjO0H03ll-f2dnMvsoWmJH4SPeTEgH1VmcjwnD3nCNRI","width":5312}],"place_id":"ChIJyb9j2xzExokRDa_StWvwgY4","plus_code":{"compound_code":"WQG7+4X Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","global_code":"87F6WQG7+4X"},"price_level":2,"rating":4,"reference":"ChIJyb9j2xzExokRDa_StWvwgY4","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"user_ratings_total":118,"vicinity":"6521 Woodland Ave, Philadelphia","city":"Philadelphia","reviews":[{"author_name":"Renee Robinson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113218335708113453620/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXWmVtJJv84AGPIgcvkRDZfy0LwzOQjLt-hBmiYSCXISuPXlpMH1Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I love this place they are nice people and great food.

The food was tasty and served after preparation in a timely manner that compliments the flow of conversation. I think my favorite was the Doro Wat, along with the beets, and the chickpeas, however the cheese was light and creamy and the enjira bread was mellow, tangy, soft to the touch and added the proper balance to the spices and flavors . The absolute highlight and great surprise was the staff! These were the kindest, with pleasant voices, understanding spirits and just incredible Gentleman who took out order and served us. It was as soothing as a spa date to be under their care . One last note my friends, you MUST  treat yourself to the fruit drink...where do I start...it seems to be a fresh puree of sweet tropical fruits layered in glass with various delicies. Each layer of fruit bounces with flavor as you sink your straw in at different levels to find distinct flavors of watermelon , mango etc each like memories of childhood when we played all day outdoors and  fruit was sweet & real. So much better than candy but did remind me a bit of mambas but healthy. The juice in itself could be a meal And worthy of a visit.

The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere, if I'm ever back in Vegas I will stop by again!","time":1723442943,"translated":false}]},{"business_status":"OPERATIONAL","geometry":{"location":{"lat":36.213923,"lng":-115.1004987},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":36.21526612989272,"lng":-115.0991424701073},"southwest":{"lat":36.21256647010727,"lng":-115.1018421298927}}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v1/png_71/restaurant-71.png","icon_background_color":"#FF9E67","icon_mask_base_uri":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v2/restaurant_pinlet","name":"Las Gidi Nigerian/African Foods","place_id":"ChIJZRC3m87CyIAR8WPosLphL8o","plus_code":{"compound_code":"6V7X+HR North Las Vegas, Nevada","global_code":"85866V7X+HR"},"reference":"ChIJZRC3m87CyIAR8WPosLphL8o","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"vicinity":"North Las Vegas","city":"Las Vegas","reviews":[]},{"business_status":"CLOSED_TEMPORARILY","geometry":{"location":{"lat":36.1130012,"lng":-115.2073957},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":36.11447267989272,"lng":-115.2062135701073},"southwest":{"lat":36.11177302010728,"lng":-115.2089132298927}}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v1/png_71/restaurant-71.png","icon_background_color":"#FF9E67","icon_mask_base_uri":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v2/restaurant_pinlet","name":"NU Ethiopian kitchen","permanently_closed":true,"photos":[{"height":4032,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100256316275991671423\">A A</a>"],"photo_reference":"AciIO2c_qb8DYmnzvuMMEEGibRAVqXRdX_8dnaz8afnVJBdwkn4Uie9IaKjDrIw8vkC648hZBvTltnkvSJoJ9J_Yemre2lL_JtpZR_dnuCaPTXlPwWOMBn9hENQ_PbKqUSeQ3sX_WtkCSX2R8EACDohRtYrcLGQReGUGdyIgENHjBmi9wQ4pLyLmA0jItwbFpNpKJBth3gWRjqK1NVDR3y5yCqh1ld6zQUpidUbjZNP9JHN9uz4KEzi7Z6KjP20GMvMpyzUX0YXzcWjq6KELbW_BSvyX9WVZzmfpuvFYYIFu-_ot3WsNbq1FgDJHiCM38crM4Rbx1y7rvRuCTRv_rDwMGyeuEXg6vFNBPkophVXSqSVOnb677jCIigDOVmB6C5nKBUYjKwsfGb-DfQt25lKgr97ZovzmxwYZE0FeoS2AAW_qHCVh_20Wrd6BnZVzU-YpRAD-wj5nK7HaeWbKlW8xSU87LSu6udQIszr_1Q7Wo_rq6Z_m54wKuQQM69-tVxOlU0OzVobh6m5LDjHKc9WwX7ER_73svpqnQqyC4naZzN8uJnonAy8K0PHMxnXB-5M5PxPFkw","width":3024}],"place_id":"ChIJ8wc9hUrHyIARFm5c3PGXgD4","plus_code":{"compound_code":"4Q7V+62 Las Vegas, Nevada","global_code":"85864Q7V+62"},"rating":4.8,"reference":"ChIJ8wc9hUrHyIARFm5c3PGXgD4","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"user_ratings_total":64,"vicinity":"4230 S Decatur Blvd Suite 200, Las Vegas","city":"Las Vegas","reviews":[{"author_name":"Arn","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112679687231150030555/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWQFghBu8djBZxhJT_-CAfuuv-HBrA44csnhoE7cTIW1HTcUKU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Great Ethiopian food and service.
