We ordered the herbed jollof rice, grilled chicken leg quarters, peppered turkey flats, and a stewed spinach dish. Since our order was quite large, we did have to wait about half an hour, so chef treated us with 2 boxes of fresh puff puff! These were like bite-sized Nigerian beignets, dusted with nutmeg and cinnamon sugar, and had 2 dipping options of habanero+mango and a sweet creamy glaze-like sauce. So thoughtful, and really curbed our hanger. Once we brought the food home, I did not take a great picture, because the smell was so intoxicating that we all dug right in.

It is how ever more filling and comes with more spinach so you don't need to order a veggie option with it. I did order a side, but my date and I could not finish 1/3 of the food we ordered and we tried our best for maybe 45 minutes of digging in.\n\nOne thing I noticed is their injera is very thick and not as even as other places but tastes like it was made with healthier ingredients so I liked it. Just not it's not as spongy and consistent as a lot of other places. Not good or bad, just something I noticed.\n\nOh yea. And their water. 4 of 5. Had a bit of background taste. But barely. Our glasses were clean and yes their give you glass. Some places have dirty glasses or more more refreshing water, but im haply they are very clean here. More clean than most 4 and 5 star places, they will swear they have clean utensils, but still dirty looking. Smh, but not here.\n\nWhat about the scenery. Nice. Not the best, maybe a 3.75/5 for interior and a 2/5 for the outside. It's next to autozone and a drugstore with many beggars and people lurking the lot.

Based on the previous reviews here, I ordered the vegetarian combo and it exceeded my expectations. Its not any kind of fancy food, but simple food prepared well. The combo had around nine separate portions of lentils, beetroot, beans, cabbage preparations. This might sound so basic and a everyday home food, but you need to give it a shot. The bread was soft and flavorful. I also ordered the lamb tibbs and it was good, the meat was tender and well cooked. This was more than a sufficient for two people at a reasonable price of less than $50. The service was great too. The waitress did a very good job of quickly attending us and explaining the menu since this was my first time and also provided their recommendations. You will find plenty of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. I liked how the payment was to be made using a QR code from your own phone. There is ample parking around in the residential area. The food has now encouraged me to try some other Ethiopian restaurants however will definitely be back here. My only disappointment was they do not have any desert option on the menu.","time":1682707485,"translated":false}]},{"business_status":"OPERATIONAL","geometry":{"location":{"lat":47.6081623,"lng":-122.2959145},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":47.60943102989272,"lng":-122.2944931701073},"southwest":{"lat":47.60673137010728,"lng":-122.2971928298927}}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v1/png_71/restaurant-71.png","icon_background_color":"#FF9E67","icon_mask_base_uri":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v2/restaurant_pinlet","international_phone_number":"+1 206-324-6402","name":"Agelgil Ethiopian Restaurant Seattle","opening_hours":{"open_now":true},"photos":[{"height":3024,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116425172904025108429\">Ihor Leshko</a>"],"photo_reference":"AZLasHp33UNfSpp1ORCmYDqx3o38ZYgP1CNBYQJeFmI8pWDXVFcpbjRLe0mDrr-zUQCXGH-10GJkf1li-ekyNjc9vl3716CABSUNT2jqViia-8vts_ljUx2aLXZZdLf-G-Clpz8FSVXwjuI19WRfowidywTBlGLABfmNl9wfvECJjyhWpkF81RikkS-CQaNBIU9yHOFKoJgtcWln5brUcarlKklnA5Hw1SDQcWf4UkUTRDdbFddO2gb53FBdZV0TFL0vo5T3dHVIVHp7EfY4kpVtKcMGHAOdX7W-QJCXf11ofAXK5P7cR0RqHzaupocaxv5IgbdTuiDIrz9g-cR2TrepTkD-A-CcttEVm5jU7JB3ZoGylrE2SEK5lZYc_CcjkrMLrVRpeqFGH63GK10PkK9EqGfc7fI_eNDqbdd3XOadBmI4X_jTGWmZrDHKMuxSGwt_b5BWpubl_RZIxW-bCZBEJ3eaBKCLP9SjhQfFqFfY6OiUPulK6FwxhhbXxYyBJoPzyKNoQcaGNdMUF_3ZHiCIhlPU_8RnpvEArVJung_8FEr5eK5lYBvYiCak-zIwm_H_wsnMVvSR","width":4032}],"place_id":"ChIJx4g-HdxqkFQROLzOhfSfpYc","price_level":2,"rating":4.6,"reference":"ChIJx4g-HdxqkFQROLzOhfSfpYc","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"user_ratings_total":485,"vicinity":"2800 E Cherry St a, Seattle","city":"Seattle","reviews":[{"author_name":"Eden Birhanu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100508964616691235725/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJtdymjjsdT73Pllsw7pAmeCirPISL93owqIiN499IU7HycJw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The firfir is literally full of jalapeños , and some of the items in the veggie combo has funny taste to it","time":1764130715,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kat Lana","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105899788732380426666/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWCFlpzTai_OBv1NFFc7Xw6ftgqoYz_A3gosSgRxSakPaqV6sAtDw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Our favorite eithopian place in Seattle.

We appreciated their help when going over the menu and selecting the right options. We went with a softer textured meat (can’t remember the name of the plate) and the Veggie Combo.\n\nMy husband cannot eat very spicy food, so finding less spicy food options can be a bit tricky.

Curious about the bitterness, I poked around and can see what it looks like to be burnt bottom pieces? For the meat, I can see that its all bony stewing hen pieces. Possibly the worst meat to eat as they are tougher and dryer with littlw to no meat. I wanted to like it but have to admit, this was the worst egusi soup I've had. I've had better egusi soup that came out of a 10oz container with no meat at all and was satisfied with the affordable price. For almost $30, it is not worth it. I'd tip extra to have my food delivered from outside of the area.","time":1755116379,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Tomanik'e Howard","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106071799217057145450/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXqTvrmPD3f-_fXcxtDEJGxh986m39lLSpzx1sBN2NB5kcNjhCAUw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"The food was SO good!

Everything was lackluster. The meat pie ingredients tasted muddled, I did enjoy the crust tho. The jollof rice flavor was mild, I wish it stood out more… as in more tomato taste, more richness… anything to resemble Nigerian jollof. The steak suya was fine… it was a bit tough, and majority of the flavor came from the sprinkled suya spice over top. The plantain was light skin and hard and they weren’t very sweet. I’ve been meaning to try the restaurant and I finally did.

And I’m glad I did!\n\nFirst the food. Delicious!  I have a feeling most people come in already knowing what they want or at least speak Yoruba. The menu does not have any descriptions, but there are a few pictures on the wall to help.  Since this was my first time having Nigerian food, I asked them to choose for me, only telling them “no fish or rice” and that “I like meat and vegetables”.  Was rewarded with a healthy portion of efo riru (Nigerian spinach stew) with added meat (cubes of stewed beef) and a softball sized portion of hot fufu. Cost $17 and I was stuffed.\n\nAlthough they gave me utensils, I ate it traditionally with my hands scooping the stew together with the fufu. The stew was really good! Very flavorful and not overly spicy. There was plenty of vegetables and was cooked just right. If I had to offer a suggestion - the added meat could have been smaller and in more even pieces. But it’s very small complaint.\n\nService: was good! My\nMeal was ready quickly and was packed up securely with napkins and utensils.\n\nAtmosphere : There are three or so booths to eat at, with lots of napkins and salt shakers, but it’s really a take it to go place - a “hole in the wall” neighborhood place where your money is going to the food, not the decor. I ate in because I live more than 40 minutes away and was starving.\n\nThere is a handwashing station so you can wash your hands before and after eating. Also got to watch some news on the large screen tv.\n\nValue : $17 dollars and I was happily stuffed. I could have made into two meals but was very hungry.

I can't call it decor because that word does not do justice to the lovely walls that appear to be beautiful wood carvings, nor does the term decor have the esteem to refer to the cultural artifacts thoughtfully placed about - the natural enhancement of lighting , and the comfortable seating areas with clean adorable apolstrty. The food was tasty and served after preparation in a timely manner that compliments the flow of conversation. I think my favorite was the Doro Wat, along with the beets, and the chickpeas, however the cheese was light and creamy and the enjira bread was mellow, tangy, soft to the touch and added the proper balance to the spices and flavors . The absolute highlight and great surprise was the staff! These were the kindest, with pleasant voices, understanding spirits and just incredible Gentleman who took out order and served us. It was as soothing as a spa date to be under their care . One last note my friends, you MUST  treat yourself to the fruit drink...where do I start...it seems to be a fresh puree of sweet tropical fruits layered in glass with various delicies. Each layer of fruit bounces with flavor as you sink your straw in at different levels to find distinct flavors of watermelon , mango etc each like memories of childhood when we played all day outdoors and  fruit was sweet & real. So much better than candy but did remind me a bit of mambas but healthy. The juice in itself could be a meal And worthy of a visit. Please do go, and thx again to the Staff for making this a peaceful wonderful meal. We arrived mid afternoon and left full and happy.

Tucked away in a quieter neighborhood just off the Strip, it’s easy to find with plenty of parking. We discovered it thanks to our Eritrean cab driver, who highly recommended it.\n\nWe ordered a veggie combo and two samosas, which were the perfect portions for our family of three. The food had a home-style touch, satisfying without feeling heavy—something we appreciated. The service was surprisingly quick, especially for an Ethiopian restaurant, and the staff was warm and welcoming.\n\nThat said, there’s room for improvement. The women’s restroom was clogged during our visit, and while the flavors were enjoyable, they could have been a bit more complex.
