Flavorful and mildly seasoned paired well with the bread.\n\nYebeg Alicha... the bread, injera, was soaked with beef and seasoning with a tangy flavir.\n\nKitfo ... was ground steak tartar which will make you spice lovers extremely happy.\n\n... an even spicier chicken and vegetable dish with hard boiled egg.\n\nThis dish was a wonderful way to sample such an awesome variety of foods and flavors.

I placed a simple food order well before my lunch break, expecting it to arrive in a timely manner. Instead, it took 2.5 hours for the delivery to be completed with no communication or updates about the delay until I reached out myself.\nBecause of this, I completely missed my lunch break and didn’t even get to enjoy the food I paid for. To make matters worse, after keeping a customer waiting that long, there was no apology, no complimentary item, or any gesture to make up for the inconvenience. This is unacceptable and shows a clear lack of regard for customers’ time and experience. I hope you take this feedback seriously and improve your communication and service recovery forward.\n\nOn August 6th-\nI placed an order at 6:35 PM and by 9:46 PM, I still had not received my food. When the DoorDash driver finally arrived, a verbal argument broke out between the driver and a representative from this business. Shockingly, the rep refused to hand over the delivery to the driver — but did call me to inform me of the situation.\n\nDespite multiple attempts to contact the business and get an update, I received no clear answers for nearly an hour.

This occasion made me visit at least 2-3 other times.\n\nOn the 2nd or third time, I didn't really care for the wings because they were starting to get a little too big, and I like my wings on the smaller side. The rice is always great with the  sauce they provide and more than enough plantains. The last time I went, I got the lamb, and that was really good.

The side sauce that you eat with the rice was amazing! I should've gotten the jollof rice because the white rice was very mediocre. It was a little overcooked and not as fluffy and Shelly as the last couple of times when I had it. I ordered the half lamb, half chicken. The lamb was delicious and cooked to perfection. The chicken was just \"ok,\" and I'll need to broil it at home to get it completely right.\n\nI also found out that I had a free reward for an order of six chicken wings. The wings were fine but not up to par of where they were before. You can tell they were sitting because they were not as crispy when I visited previous times.

I did order a side, but my date and I could not finish 1/3 of the food we ordered and we tried our best for maybe 45 minutes of digging in.\n\nOne thing I noticed is their injera is very thick and not as even as other places but tastes like it was made with healthier ingredients so I liked it. Just not it's not as spongy and consistent as a lot of other places. Not good or bad, just something I noticed.\n\nOh yea. And their water. 4 of 5. Had a bit of background taste. But barely. Our glasses were clean and yes their give you glass. Some places have dirty glasses or more more refreshing water, but im haply they are very clean here. More clean than most 4 and 5 star places, they will swear they have clean utensils, but still dirty looking. Smh, but not here.\n\nWhat about the scenery. Nice. Not the best, maybe a 3.75/5 for interior and a 2/5 for the outside. It's next to autozone and a drugstore with many beggars and people lurking the lot.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the music set a really nice vibe that made the evening enjoyable. The food itself was very good…full of flavor and definitely worth coming back for.\n\nThat said, the service was a bit confusing. The restaurant uses a self-service system, but it seemed to be missing some options that should have been available. We briefly spoke to a server, but they disappeared after a quick exchange, leaving us unsure of how to proceed. Eventually, I believe it was the bartender who ended up taking our order, and they were very kind and helpful, which I appreciated.\n\nSo while the start of the experience felt a little disorganized, the food and the overall atmosphere made up for it.

Again, quite modest in aesthetic but it looks like it is a family-friendly option where they put on their own celebratory events.\n\nVery worth a try.","time":1748159652,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Stephanie Chang","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114563934562518117717/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFgQxjvjAI9Udxznq_u8bt6_Y14FwMaj_g9urVdqr9nnLrFG8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Unfortunately not the best.

Food looked good but my first bite in was lacking a lot of flavor. It was bland and almost tasted a little bitter. Curious about the bitterness, I poked around and can see what it looks like to be burnt bottom pieces? For the meat, I can see that its all bony stewing hen pieces. Possibly the worst meat to eat as they are tougher and dryer with littlw to no meat. I wanted to like it but have to admit, this was the worst egusi soup I've had. I've had better egusi soup that came out of a 10oz container with no meat at all and was satisfied with the affordable price. For almost $30, it is not worth it.

I believe they toned down the seasoning a bit to potentially serve people that couldn't handle spice, which resulted in their food overall on the plain side relatively. There are still some highlights worth pointing out, though, which I will try to do.\n\nI thought the ater kik and the shiro were overall well made, and one bite with a chunk of injera offered a traditionally tasty experience. Miser was okay, and could use more seasoning in my opinion. The doro wot also didn't have enough spice, and the chicken didn't necessarily have an \"off the bone\" quality like I would have loved. The lantil alicha was pretty good because lentils, which wouldn't normally be considered tasty, were pretty tasty. Both the yabesha gomen (kale) and tikel gomen (cabbage) were unfortunately bland as well in comparison.\n\nSpending just around $13 for a veggie firfir, which was a veggie sampler for one person, was a good deal, though.

The soup was rich and hearty, with stew chicken and beef. It was served with a generous portion of white rice.

One last note my friends, you MUST  treat yourself to the fruit drink...where do I start...it seems to be a fresh puree of sweet tropical fruits layered in glass with various delicies. Each layer of fruit bounces with flavor as you sink your straw in at different levels to find distinct flavors of watermelon , mango etc each like memories of childhood when we played all day outdoors and  fruit was sweet & real. So much better than candy but did remind me a bit of mambas but healthy. The juice in itself could be a meal And worthy of a visit.

I was looking for a hookah venue and stumbled upon this place in my search. As a first timer, I’d have to say the customer service was outstanding and food was delicious. I got here around 4pm and didn’t know the hookah spot doesn’t open until 9pm. Only the restaurant was opened. However the staff and owner were so kind and accommodated me wanting both food and hookah. Additionally the restaurant opened two weeks ago so I feel great I had the experience of both. Highly recommended and the Hookah menu is amazing. So many flavors and ones I’ve never knew about it. I’m high impressed and I will be back again soon! Thank you all for the exceptional customer experience.","time":1728000566,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Joi Chilton","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106829605964861662532/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUqNBDd5xHqvJIl1yitIcLPC-dksLCy3gmCSMD8utsIKh87DHdXRg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"I LOVE IT HERE .....
