Had it not been for a buddy of mine It would still go unnoticed. It sits nearest the last last house on St. marks corner of Utica Ave in BKLYN. There is nothing pretty nor inviting about the outer appearance and sadly to say the same for the inside. The place is very small and the immediate seating area upon entering is usually cluttered with closed together chairs and papers on the tables. Judging from my statement as to usually tells you I have been here more than twice. After you enter if you look to the right there is a cut out about the size of a nook. It holds about 4 small tables and chairs, the mini bar is too the left of the entrance. The place is very untidy. I was a bit scared to eat here at first but my friend has been sick so... I was taken back when I saw the small kitchen. Unbelievably it held 3 employees. Had it not been the size difference of them all small med and large they would not have fit... LOL sounds funny but I am serious!The kitchen is not well kept but the board of health has not been here yet I guess since the openings. I don't see a NYC rating either. 🤔 Hmm. Oh well on to the food The first time I had a delicious fish soup nice and pepper like I like my food. If you like hot 🔥 here it is In This lil hole \"The wall\"🧱 Try it is all I have to say make sure you get the right fufu. I came back with my best friend who is from Nigeria because he didn't believe my taste buds until he tried it himself. I treated him to Seafood okra. You would think he hadn't eaten for years the way he gulped it down and looking into my plate. I admit it was good. But I don't thinthey serve this often . At the cost of $25 it was overpriced but delicious. The last time I went back I was sadly disappointed. I was hoping the rubbish I saw at the door and the untidy area would be cleaned up but I will have to at this just how they keep it. Very sad. Although I enjoyed the food I will not return because the surrounding makes a difference as to what goes into your food. If the kitchen is messy and it is then the food is not at its best even if it tastes good.

I ordered the seasoned beef (yeawaze tibs) and vegetable combo which was served on a large plate over a large piece of bread very similar to a fluffy crepe.  It is also served with a side of the bread (injera, 30% barley 70% \"teff\") which you tear off and use to grab pieces of meat and veggies (Lentils, cabbage and carrots, spinach greens).  If you're traditional you use only your bare right hand to eat with, which can be a bit off putting for some but it's how it's done.  Just wash your hands before and after in the very basic facilities.\n\nThe flavors are all there, about as authentic as you can get them in So Cal.  The atmosphere is about as close to what you might get sitting at a small cafe in Addis Ababa too.  Well seasoned food with a variety of flavors.  There is also a lot of food, and after ordering the two dishes I ended up taking him about half of it even with two people eating.\n\nThis is a very small restaurant, blink and you'll miss it kind of establishment with no dedicated parking, just street park where you can.  Inside the place is a very tiny main dining area (1 four top, 1 two top) and what looks like a larger social room but only for sitting on the floor (reserved or dedicated?).  I didn't really get the impression that being a restaurant was their main focus, as the kitchen was far bigger than the dining room (I think they make the specialty bread and sell it as a big part of their income).\n\nI really enjoyed the experience, the very homestyle feeling of the place like you're walking into someone's home.  For some people the whole no frills experience might be a huge turnoff, but it was definitely not for me.  I concede it was odd to see a very limited selection of bottled beverages in a cooler that wasn't chilled, so I can understand why some people might not care for it.

Not knowing anything about Ethiopian food, I was wide-eyed and ready for anything. It was far too difficult to pick anything to order with no clue as to what things might be to our taste. So we went with the Mahberawi, an amazing platter with six different items, two very spicy dishes, and 4 other flavorful dishes.  Along with the platter came a bowl of what looked to be a thin bread but more spongy.  I was familiar wnough with ethiopian food from a prior visit that one takes a piece of the injera and scoops up a mouthful portion and enjoy.\n\n... is tomato, spices with onions and ground beef with a tanky flavor. It was very mild and quite tasty.\n\n.... is a bit like carne asada mixed with onion and seasoning which was very satisfying.\n\n... omg the beef with collard greens was amazing. Flavorful and mildly seasoned paired well with the bread.\n\nYebeg Alicha... the bread, injera, was soaked with beef and seasoning with a tangy flavir.\n\nKitfo ... was ground steak tartar which will make you spice lovers extremely happy.\n\n... an even spicier chicken and vegetable dish with hard boiled egg.\n\nThis dish was a wonderful way to sample such an awesome variety of foods and flavors.

I placed a simple food order well before my lunch break, expecting it to arrive in a timely manner. Instead, it took 2.5 hours for the delivery to be completed with no communication or updates about the delay until I reached out myself.\nBecause of this, I completely missed my lunch break and didn’t even get to enjoy the food I paid for. To make matters worse, after keeping a customer waiting that long, there was no apology, no complimentary item, or any gesture to make up for the inconvenience. This is unacceptable and shows a clear lack of regard for customers’ time and experience. I hope you take this feedback seriously and improve your communication and service recovery forward.\n\nOn August 6th-\nI placed an order at 6:35 PM and by 9:46 PM, I still had not received my food. When the DoorDash driver finally arrived, a verbal argument broke out between the driver and a representative from this business.

I was first introduced to them in the parking lot of the Bowie Town Center. I had the spicy honey wings with jollof rice and plantains. It was immaculate!!! This occasion made me visit at least 2-3 other times.\n\nOn the 2nd or third time, I didn't really care for the wings because they were starting to get a little too big, and I like my wings on the smaller side. The rice is always great with the  sauce they provide and more than enough plantains. The last time I went, I got the lamb, and that was really good. I'll definitely return, but the area is kind of busy with traffic and not the easiest to get to when I'm commuting.\n\nPost Update 6/29/25: I visited this establishment again for at least the 4th time. The side sauce that you eat with the rice was amazing! I should've gotten the jollof rice because the white rice was very mediocre. It was a little overcooked and not as fluffy and Shelly as the last couple of times when I had it. I ordered the half lamb, half chicken. The lamb was delicious and cooked to perfection. The chicken was just \"ok,\" and I'll need to broil it at home to get it completely right.\n\nI also found out that I had a free reward for an order of six chicken wings. The wings were fine but not up to par of where they were before. You can tell they were sitting because they were not as crispy when I visited previous times. Overall, the food was mostly good and suffice, so I'll rate my recent experience a 7.8/10.

We ordered the herbed jollof rice, grilled chicken leg quarters, peppered turkey flats, and a stewed spinach dish. Since our order was quite large, we did have to wait about half an hour, so chef treated us with 2 boxes of fresh puff puff!

So thoughtful, and really curbed our hanger. Once we brought the food home, I did not take a great picture, because the smell was so intoxicating that we all dug right in.

On this trip I ordered their special kitfo. Previously I ordered the fish cutlet. Not my usual choices so it's hard to rate them based on other experiences. The fish cutlet was ok, bit they did let me know before hand the other fish dish is preferred.\n\nI would say their special spinach kitfo is very good, but not better than special gomen kitfo I've had elsewhere. It is how ever more filling and comes with more spinach so you don't need to order a veggie option with it. I did order a side, but my date and I could not finish 1/3 of the food we ordered and we tried our best for maybe 45 minutes of digging in.\n\nOne thing I noticed is their injera is very thick and not as even as other places but tastes like it was made with healthier ingredients so I liked it. Just not it's not as spongy and consistent as a lot of other places. Not good or bad, just something I noticed.\n\nOh yea. And their water. 4 of 5. Had a bit of background taste. But barely. Our glasses were clean and yes their give you glass. Some places have dirty glasses or more more refreshing water, but im haply they are very clean here. More clean than most 4 and 5 star places, they will swear they have clean utensils, but still dirty looking. Smh, but not here.\n\nWhat about the scenery. Nice.

Food looked good but my first bite in was lacking a lot of flavor. It was bland and almost tasted a little bitter. Curious about the bitterness, I poked around and can see what it looks like to be burnt bottom pieces? For the meat, I can see that its all bony stewing hen pieces. Possibly the worst meat to eat as they are tougher and dryer with littlw to no meat. I wanted to like it but have to admit, this was the worst egusi soup I've had. I've had better egusi soup that came out of a 10oz container with no meat at all and was satisfied with the affordable price. For almost $30, it is not worth it.

The Amala was soft and smooth, just as it should be, and paired perfectly with the rich, savory Ewedu soup. The flavors were incredibly well-balanced, with the Ewedu bringing that classic, slightly earthy taste that complements the mild, fermented undertone of the Amala.\n\nThe goat meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of spice to give it a flavorful kick. The fish added another layer of deliciousness to the dish, flaky and well-cooked, soaking up the savory goodness of the soup.\n\nBeyond the delicious food, the atmosphere at Toni’s African Deli is warm and inviting, with a friendly staff that makes you feel right at home. Whether you’re an aficionado of African cuisine or trying it for the first time, Toni’s African Deli is a must-visit.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for something truly comforting and hearty, I highly recommend giving Toni’s African Deli a try.

I’m a mom who cooks at home often , and I rarely get takeout because it’s overpriced and not the most healthiest choice. I HATE wasting my money especially in these times ! Let me say this,  I LOVE African Food and have tried many different restaurants in the cities.  I decided to get dinner here, my first time visiting this place. I paid $20. and some change , for Spinach/rice, they did throw in the ‘hot pepper’ since I guess you have to ask for it and it’s an additional charge and they only take cash for items under $5.,  I didn’t know you had to ask , I just thought about it from experiences at other establishments and then wondered if it came with it, ok fine. Moving on to the food, the spinach bowl was small for $20. in my opinion, I mean who’s counting the rice , its rice and I got plenty of that, you’d think it would be the other way around. There were 3 medium size pieces of meat that pretty much overpowered the whole bowl of spinach with regards to size , I think the amount of spinach had to be no more than a ice cream scoop and unfortunately it was super oily and bland, NO flavor , just heavy on the grease and chewy meat with a splash of red sauce on top which was spicy. My stomach is bubbling right now !! Unfortunately after about 3 try’s , I couldn’t take another bite and my kids didn’t want any, so I had to cook anyway !!! I’m so frustrated with restaurants playing in my face! I think the restaurant should take some time and reevaluate their recipes and  the overall flavor if they feel that they deserve what they’re charging, and try ASKING customers if they’d like to add a side of pepper or let them know the food is already spicy  !!! Gee wiz simple customer service goes a long way to see to it that your customers are prepared especially for culturally made dishes. You don’t know who’s walking in that door. Honestly I’d be happy with the price only if the food was good and worth it, it’s possible (I’ve been to plenty upscale restaurants who upcharge for great tasting small portions) I won’t be back until the reviews are at 5 stars, becausw then I’ll know someone listened and took some of this feedback as an opportunity, but meanwhile I wouldn’t recommend!!","time":1717894886,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Anastaria Carter","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113526242571451676747/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW5dYJHMp0-dek2IiUucl5Fx4ucLOa7b4uPfswLBH5UzXw4A1j7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"I ordered through Uber eats and it was the Egusi with goat meat with extra meat and fufu.

The oxtails are perfectly cooked, falling apart, and simmered in a velvety sauce with chunks of potato and pepper that taste like they’ve stewed with the unctuous meat all day long. The sambusas are filled with meat; the wrapper light, flakey, and crisp without being heavy or oily. Get some of their hot sauce on the side- it’s great for dipping, adding to any food on the menu, or saving in your fridge to use as a condiment for literally anything else you eat. And the portions are huge! I get three or four meals out of each entree. Blow this place up!

The jollof rice flavor was mild, I wish it stood out more… as in more tomato taste, more richness… anything to resemble Nigerian jollof.

If you have, just skip it. It’s not bad but since it’s in an area with lots of African restaurants it doesn’t hold up to the competition in the area. Emma’s is a few blocks away and sooo much better. We tried the palava sauce and the pepper soup. It was not as spicy as most West African food tends to be but came with pepper sauce on the side to turn the heat up. The food had a good flavor but it wasn’t cooked long enough for the flavor to really get into the meat & bones. The cow foot was very tough and the fish in the soup was underdone. The fufu was not mixed well. It was edible but I was disappointed knowing I could have gone somewhere else nearby for much better food.
